## Introduction

My path to software engineering wasn't a straight line. I started with a degree in Electrical Engineering, focused on signal processing and communication theory. But somewhere along the way, I discovered my passion for building software systems that solve real-world problems.

## The Beginning: Electrical Engineering

During my undergraduate years at Shaoxing University, I learned the fundamentals of circuits, microcontrollers, and signal processing. Working with STM32 microcontrollers and building embedded systems gave me my first taste of programming.

## The Turning Point: Machine Learning Research

My master's program at Harbin University of Science and Technology changed everything. I started working on AI-powered fault diagnosis systems for rotating machinery. This is where I fell in love with Python, TensorFlow, and the power of machine learning.

Building end-to-end ML pipelines, from hardware integration to model deployment, taught me the importance of software engineering principles in AI applications.

## The Leap: Full-Stack Development

When I moved to the United States for my second master's at the University of Pittsburgh, I decided to dive deep into web development. Learning Spring Boot, React, and modern DevOps practices opened up a whole new world.

My internship at Genius Electronic Optical (Apple's lens supplier) taught me how to write production-grade code at scale. Working on industrial testing software and collaborating with Apple's camera team was an incredible learning experience.

## Where I Am Now

Today, I'm a full-stack engineer working on clinical research platforms at the University of Pittsburgh. I build applications that help real people - from mobile apps for participants to web portals for clinicians managing hundreds of patients across multiple institutions.

## What's Next?

I'm constantly learning and expanding my skillset. Currently, I'm exploring:
- Distributed systems architecture
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications
- Advanced machine learning techniques

The journey continues, and I'm excited about what's ahead!
