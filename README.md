Hi guys, this is a practice of deploying a website. I deployed my personal blog to share tech posts and insights. I plan to write about:
- LeetCode solutions and explanations
- Course insights and learning resources
- General life thoughts and reflections

Feel free to discuss with me - I'm happy to help others when I can! Writing in English also helps me improve my communication skills. I particularly value one-to-one conversations.
